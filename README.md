# MiscWhatever!

Welcome to MiscWhatever (pronounced *"miss-whatever"*), my first ever C++ project! It's a little toy CLI full of little programs, Easter eggs, and funny little "why would they add that" commands :p

I use a lot *(?)* of Windows stuff so you'd have to tweak some stuff to get it to work on other operating systems.

*Anywayyyy* I don't really know what else to put here *soo*... have fun!!! Also there are quite a few <ins>secrets</ins>, although if you looked through the code, you'd probably know what they are, so I guess more-so Easter eggs.

## Why though?
Why not? Why NOT have your first C++ project be a weird little CLI? Judgy...

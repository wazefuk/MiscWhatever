# MiscWhatever!

Welcome to MiscWhatever (pronounced "miss-whatever"), my first ever C++ project! It's a little toy CLI full of little programs, Easter eggs, and funny little "why would they add that" commands :p

I use a lot(?) of Windows stuff so you'd have to tweak some stuff to get it to work on other operating systems.

Anywayyyy I don't really know what else to put here soo... have fun!!!

## Why though?
Why not? Why NOT have your first C++ project be a weird little CLI? Judgy...
